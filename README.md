The Online Multiplayer Game for Technothlon Mains !
Fluxo de Energia is a multiplayer game inspired from Virtual Stock Market to enable children to ~~learn~~ Experience how the stock market works.
This game involves three characters : Gods, Investors and Farmers. Each player gets to play every role in the duration of the whole game.

The students played against each other in real-time, in a quest to make trades and increase their life energy! A player could take up many roles, invest, grow and sell. The ultimate aim was to make the most profit. Being a real-time event, each player's action affected the other, resulting in a very dynamic game which had the participants thinking and planning at all times.

The whole game is built on Laravel 4.2
